        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: February 13, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to Dharma. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal
            information.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>DHARMA collects various types of information to provide and improve our Case Management services:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Name, phone number, email address, and physical address or
                location data.</li>
            <li><strong>Case-Related Content:</strong> Case descriptions, incident details, images, voice notes,
                documents, and other file attachments you upload.</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication Data:</strong> Login credentials managed through Firebase Authentication.</li>
            <li><strong>Automated Data:</strong> Device information, IP address, and app usage statistics to ensure
                security and performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide and improve our legal assistance services.</li>
            <li>Personalize your experience within the app.</li>
            <li>Communicate with you regarding updates or support.</li>
            <li>Ensure the security and integrity of our platform.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Access</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal information to third parties. Data is shared only in the following contexts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Authorized Law Enforcement:</strong> Case details submitted by citizens are accessible to
                authorized police officers and administrators within the systems for investigation and management.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We use Google Firebase for backend services including
                authentication, database hosting, and file storage. These providers are bound by strict data protection
                agreements.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or in response to
                valid legal requests by public authorities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>We implement robust security measures, including encryption in transit and at rest (via Firebase), to
            maintain the safety of your personal information. However, no method of transmission over the internet or
            electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

        <h2>5. AI and Automated Processing</h2>
        <p>DHARMA uses AI features to assist in organizing, summarizing, and prioritizing cases. These automated
            processes help in efficient case management but do not replace final human judgment by authorized officials.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>We retain your personal data and case information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which

            deletion by contacting us at the email provided below.</p>

            information from children. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal data, please
            contact us immediately.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information. You can manage certain aspects of
            your data within the app settings or by contacting our support team.</p>
