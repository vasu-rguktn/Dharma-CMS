### Before Using These Features:

You need to configure the API endpoints. Currently, all screens have placeholder API calls:

```dart

final response = await _dio.post(
  '/api/legal-suggestion',  // ← Update this to your actual API
  data: {...},
);
```

### Steps to Configure:

1. Open each screen file
2. Find the `TODO` comment
3. Replace `/api/...` with your actual backend URL
4. Example: `https://your-backend.com/api/legal-suggestion`

**Files to update**:
- `lib/screens/legal_suggestion_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/document_drafting_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/chargesheet_generation_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/chargesheet_vetting_screen.dart`
