## ❓ FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### **Q1: Why can't I select Police Station during registration?**
**A**: You haven't selected your rank, or your rank doesn't require a station field. Only DSP, Inspector, SI, ASI, HC, and PC need to select a police station.

---

### **Q2: I selected Range but District dropdown is still disabled. Why?**
**A**: Make sure you've selected a Range first. The District dropdown only activates after Range is selected.

---

### **Q3: I'm a DGP. Why am I seeing so many petitions?**
**A**: As DGP, you have state-level access. You can see ALL petitions. Use the Range/District/Station filters to narrow down your view.

---

### **Q4: I'm an Inspector but I can't see my colleague's petitions from the next station.**
**A**: Correct! Station-level officers can ONLY see petitions from their own station. If you need access to other stations, contact your SP.

---

### **Q5: Can I change my assigned station after registration?**
**A**: No, you cannot change it yourself. Contact your admin or senior officer to update your assignment in the system.

---

### **Q6: I made a mistake in Range/District selection. Can I go back?**
**A**: Yes! The form automatically resets dependent fields when you change a higher-level selection. For example:
- Change Range → District and Station reset
- Change District → Station resets

---

### **Q7: How do I search for a specific police station? There are so many!**
**A**: All dropdowns are searchable! Click the dropdown, and a search box will appear. Type part of the station name to filter the list.
